# Probability Calculator
The project creates a "hat" that contains different colored balls, such as 5 blue balls, 4 red balls, and 2 green balls.<br><br>
The Probability Calculator returns the probability of drawing any (e.g. 4) number of balls containing a specific subset of balls (e.g. 1 red ball and 2 green balls). To approximate the probability, the program performs a large number of experiments (draws) and estimates the probability.
